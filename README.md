# Simple Notepad

The first project for Xtern Bootcamp 2018 Session 3 -- remodeled!

* This is a simple notepad made with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Motivation

* The motivation behind this project came from the Xtern Bootcamp project that was about listing out movies and their actors. It has been altered to be a notepad instead, providing more of a practical purpose to the user.

## Features

* It features a small form to fill out with your note and displays the note on the side after being saved. The note can be marked as important or deleted once it is no longer needed.

## Credits

* Based off Davey's code (dstrus) from the Xtern Bootcamp 2018 Session 3.
